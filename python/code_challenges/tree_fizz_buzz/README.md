# K-ary Trees

## Challenge

Conduct "FizzBuzz" on a Kary Tree while traversing through to create a new tree

## API

### Kary Tree

We wrote a function called fizz buzz tree

Arguments: k-ary tree
Return: new k-ary tree
Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

If the value is divisible by 3, we replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, we replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, we replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

Note to self - if you are having an import error for the tests:
- make sure there is an __init__.py file
- Make sure the folder name has UNDERSCORES and NOT dashes
