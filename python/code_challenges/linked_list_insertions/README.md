# Singly Linked List
A challenge of adding three singly linked list insertion methods to the previously written linked list functionality.

## Challenge
Create append, insert-before and insert-after methods as well as tests pass the tests in the data_structures folder for said methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
The Approach was to use while loops to traverse the linked lists. This is O(N)

## API
Append Method to insert something to the end of the linked list.
Insert-before method to insert a new value before a certain value in the list.
Insert-after method to insert a new value after a certain value in the list.

Worked with Brian on the whiteboard and on writing the code for this challenge.

In this lab I was unable to get the tests working on my machine, but we ran the tests on Brian's machine and got the three target methods of the lab working. Since I could not get the tests working I have not yet written unit tests or TargetError handling yet.
