# Singly Linked List
A challenge of adding three singly linked list insertion methods to the previously written linked list functionality.

## Challenge
Create includes, insert, and to_string methods as well as tests pass the tests in the data_structures folder for said methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
The Approach was to use while loops to traverse the linked lists. This is O(N)

## API
Insert Method to insert something into the linked list.
Includes method to return a boolean of whether something is in the list.
Str method to create a string from the values in the linked list.

Worked with Brian on the whiteboard and on writing the code for this challenge.

In this lab I was unable to get the tests working on my machine, but we ran the tests on Brian's machine and got the three target methods of the lab working.
