# Singly Linked List
A challenge of finding a given positions value in a linked list with a stretch goal of finding the midpoint value in a list.

## Challenge
Create kth_from_end and midpoint methods as well as tests pass the tests in the data_structures folder for said methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
The Approach was to use while loops to traverse the linked lists. This is O(N)

## API
Kth_from_end method to find a value a certain distance from the end of the linked list.
Midpoint method to find the middle value in the list.
