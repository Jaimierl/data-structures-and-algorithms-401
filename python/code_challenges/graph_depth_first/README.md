# Graph

A challenge of implementing a depth-first search on a graph data structure.

## API - Additional Depth First Search Method

Name: depth_first
Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
Program output: Display the collection as a list of node values

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach is to create a method in the graph implementation that adds the functionality described in the API section.
