## We worked on an Array Binary Search Problem:

In this lab I worked with Pedro Perez

We are taking in an array and a target value and using a binary search to return the position of the target value. A binary search will automatically go to the midpoint of the array and then figure whether the target value is more or less than the current position and then move to the next (either the next higher or lower) midpoint accordingly. This goes from the first set which is halving data, to the next set which quarters the data and since the groups the search will be checking are halved every time, halving exponentially or logarithmically, so this is also called a logarithmic search.

Some order can be assumed for the array since it is sorted. You need to grab a specific area within the array and compare it to what you are looking for.
