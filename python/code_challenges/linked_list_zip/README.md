# Zipped Linked List
A challenge of zipping two linked lists into place. Challenge to do this in place with a stretch goal of merging two sorted lists into a new larger sorted linked list.

## Challenge
Write a function to return a zipped linked list from two given linked lists.

## Approach & Efficiency
The Approach was to use multiple pointers while traversing the linked lists. This is O(1)

## API
zip_lists is the function that zips the two lists together
