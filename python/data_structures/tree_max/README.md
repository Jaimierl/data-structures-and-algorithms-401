# Binary Trees

## Challenge

Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## API

### Binary Tree

Extend the Binary Tree class by adding a method to:

find maximum value
Arguments: none
Returns: number
Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

The binary tree will be passed in as self. You can assume the values passed into the tree will be numeric. Values can repeat themselves - this is not necessarily a binary search tree.

Should be able to take in negative numbers. The tree will only include integers.

See the code for [The Binary Tree](/data_structures/tree_max/binary_tree.py) or the [Binary Tree Tests](/data_structures/tree_max/test_tree_max.py) by clicking on the highlighted words!

Note to self - if you are having an import error for the tests:
- make sure there is an __init__.py file
- Make sure the folder name has UNDERSCORES and NOT dashes
