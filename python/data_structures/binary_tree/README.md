# Binary Trees

## Challenge

Implement a Binary Tree and a Binary Search Tree

## API

### Binary Tree

Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:

- pre order
- in order
- post order

These should return an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

### Binary Search Tree

Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:

- Add

  Arguments: value
  Return: nothing
  Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

- Contains

  Argument: value
  Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

Worked with Brendon Hampton

See the code for [The Binary Tree](/data_structures/binary_tree/binary_tree.py) or [Binary Search Tree](/data-structures-and-algorithms-401/python/data_structures/binary_tree/binary_search_tree.py), or the [Binary Tree Tests](/data_structures/binary_tree/test_binary_tree.py) or [Binary Search Tree Tests](/data_structures/binary_tree/test_binary_search_tree.py) by clicking on the highlighted words!

Note to self - if you are having an import error for the tests:
- make sure there is an __init__.py file
- Make sure the folder name has UNDERSCORES and NOT dashes
