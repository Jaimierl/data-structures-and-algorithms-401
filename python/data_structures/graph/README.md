# Graph

A challenge of implementing a graph.

## Challenge

Create a graph class with add_node, add_edge, get_node, get_neighbor, and size methods as well as tests for said methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach is to create three classes for the Edges, Vertices, and Graphs. Then write the graph functions and tests.

## API - Graph Methods

Add_node - Adds a node to the graph
Add_edge - Adds an edge to the graph
Get_nodes - Returns a list of all of the nodes in the graph
Get_neighbors - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node (Essentially the edge contains the weight of the edge and the node on the other side of the edge).
Size - Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
