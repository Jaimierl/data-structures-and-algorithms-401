# Singly Linked List
A challenge of creating three singly linked list methods.

## Challenge
Create includes, insert, and to_string methods as well as tests pass the tests in the data_structures folder for said methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
The Approach was to use while loops to traverse the linked lists. This is O(N)

## API
Insert Method to insert something into the linked list.
Includes method to return a boolean of whether something is in the list.
Str method to create a string from the values in the linked list.

# Resources
Worked with Sergii on the file structure.
TutorialsPoint shows that else can be used with while for the includes module.
