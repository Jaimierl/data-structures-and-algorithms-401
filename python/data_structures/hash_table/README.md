# HashTable

A challenge of implementing a hash table.

## Challenge

Create set, get, contains, (all)keys, and hash methods as well as tests pass the tests in the data_structures folder for said methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach is to use test driven development based on the provided tests to write Hashtable methods.

## API

Insert Method to insert something into the linked list.
Includes method to return a boolean of whether something is in the list.
Str method to create a string from the values in the linked list.
